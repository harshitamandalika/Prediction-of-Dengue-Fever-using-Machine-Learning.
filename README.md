# Prediction-of-Dengue-Fever-using-Machine-Learning.

Dengue is a severe fever caused due to bites of  specific types of mosquitoes. Dengue fever can also be fatal and as there is no effective medication or vaccine against dengue fever, it becomes highly critical to predict the dengue cases in advance so that precautionary measures can be taken. Therefore, in this project, we predict the number of dengue cases in an area, in advance. To predict this, we use several Machine Learning algorithms and evaluate their performance to attain the best model for predicting the number of dengue cases.
